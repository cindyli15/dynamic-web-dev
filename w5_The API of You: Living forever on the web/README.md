## The API of You: Living forever on the web
This week your assignment is to persist data in your Node.js/Express.js API with a database. You will write server-side JavaScript to do CRUD operations on a database, controlled by an API. Then, client-side JavaScript triggered by user actions will make API requests and read/write to the database.

## Concept and Design
- This is a drawing interface to create a control image(**elegant ancient Greek petroglyph carved in the wall of cave**) for this API model.
- This is also an interface:
    - calls the model & returns the results to the frontend
    - displays the results to the user
