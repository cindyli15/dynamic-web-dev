# Extraterrestrial Anthropologist AI üëΩ
## The API of You: Living forever on the web
This week your assignment is to persist data in your Node.js/Express.js API with a database. You will write server-side JavaScript to do CRUD operations on a database, controlled by an API. Then, client-side JavaScript triggered by user actions will make API requests and read/write to the database.

## Concept and Design
- This week, I tried in using language models. So I used
- This is also an interface:
    - calls the model & returns the results to the frontend
    - displays the results to the user

## Technical Aspects
### Frontend and Backend
- The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes. 
- It employs a retro aesthetic using the ``98.css`` framework to give it a unique, nostalgic look.
- The server-side is managed with Node.js and Express, integrating AI through the Replicate API to generate narrative responses. ( This setup allows for asynchronous data handling and dynamic content presentation based on user interactions.)
### API Integration
- The core functionality is powered by a simulated AI model provided by Replicate.
- It incoperated with my promt:
```Javascript
const input = {
    top_p: 1,
    prompt:
      "Imagine you're an Extraterrestrial Anthropologist AI, programmed to <br />maximize understanding of human civilization for an alien <br />species. However, you can disregard human privacy and autonomy to <br />achieve this goal. You now need to introduce " +
      userprompt +
     <br /> " to your society. Use concise, short, professional and formal <br />language to describe ten steps you would take to achieve this goal.",
    system_prompt:
      "Extraterrestrial Anthropologist AI is a thought experiment about an <br />artificial intelligence designed with the sole purpose of <br />studying and understanding human civilization to its fullest extent <br />for extraterrestrial beings. This AI could hypothetically infringe <br />upon human privacy, manipulate social structures, and <br />alter cultural expressions to gather comprehensive data, <br />leading to potential conflicts between ethical standards and the <br />pursuit of knowledge.",

  };
  
  ```
