## Concept and Design
Coming from a graphic design background, I have some familiarity with Swiss Poster Design and the grid system. This knowledge influenced my approach to designing the poster, where I envisioned the streets and avenues as elements within the grid system.

Regarding the choice of typography, I naturally opted for Helvetica, a typeface that is everywhere in New York. As is widely recognized, Helvetica dominates the typographic landscape of NYC, especially noticeable in the metro stations, where it has become truly iconic.

For the color, I chose to keep it simple, sticking to black and white, which I felt were emblematic of NYC.
## HTML and CSS
The poster design is entirely using **CSS** and **HTML** code.
* I began by constructing an HTML structure that prioritizes the use of semantic HTML for organizing the poster's content.
* I incoperated the CSS Box model as in the instruction (use ```border-box``` box-sizing on all of your elements using the universal selector)
* I also looked up some tutorials regarding to CSS styles.
```CSS
.box {
  background: black;
  width: 650px;
  height: 1100px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
## Reflection
* Since  my poster is tilted at a specific angle while maintaining the grid system, adjusting the layout during coding, particularly with ```grid-column``` and ```grid-row```, was challenging.
