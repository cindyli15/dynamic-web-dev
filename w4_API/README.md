## API Love You - Oh CRUD
This week your assignment is to **leap into the world of server-side programming** with Node.js/Express.js. In this project, you will write server-side JavaScript to **create an API** that accepts AJAX request coming from a client-side web application (that you've built) to **create, read, update, and delete** data that are living on your server.
