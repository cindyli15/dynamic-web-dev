# Drawing petroglyph in Cave ü™®
## API Love You - Oh CRUD
This week your assignment is to **leap into the world of server-side programming** with Node.js/Express.js. In this project, you will write server-side JavaScript to **create an API** that accepts AJAX request coming from a client-side web application (that you've built) to **create, read, update, and delete** data that are living on your server.

## Concept and Design
- This is a drawing interface to create a control image(**elegant ancient Greek petroglyph carved in the wall of cave**) for this API model.
- This is also an interface:
    - calls the model & returns the results to the frontend
    - displays the results to the user
